<p>User-implemented plug-in for receiving and handling region entry events. A region’s cache listener is called after an entry in the local cache is modified. See also <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_40FFA1BD5E4A4E3084AE8B257C612EDE">cache writer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cache-loader"><a id="glossary__section_9CAA8CD20DBF4F948E20E384C987D0C8" class="no-quick-link"></a>cache loader</h2>

<p>User-implemented plug-in for loading data into a region. A region’s cache loader is used to load data that is requested of the region but is not available in the distributed system. For a distributed region, the loader that is used can be in a different cache from the one where the data-request operation originated. See also <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_B9B118509831405D9AB4069503119DFB">netSearch</a> and <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_BFFF4BF9D6414AA392F7AEAC1256C112">netLoad</a>.cache misses, where a requested key is not present or has a null value in the local cache.</p>

<h2 id="cache-miss"><a id="glossary__section_6D9FA50812AC45BCADA7755E4368A5C4" class="no-quick-link"></a>cache miss</h2>

<p>The situation where a key’s value is requested from a cache and the requested key is not present or has a null value. Geode responds to cache misses in various ways, depending on the region and system configuration. For example, a client region goes to its servers to satisfy cache misses. A region with local scope uses its data loader to load the value from an outside data source, if a loader is installed on the region.</p>

<h2 id="cache-server"><a id="glossary__section_cache_server" class="no-quick-link"></a>cache server</h2>

<p>A long-lived, configurable Geode distributed system member process that can service client connections.</p>

<h2 id="cache-transaction"><a id="glossary__section_cache_transaction" class="no-quick-link"></a>cache transaction</h2>

<p>A native Geode transaction, managed by Geode and not by JTA. This type of transaction operates only on data available from the Geode cache in the local member. See also <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_2B4ADA311CA946839F3E8F3B071D4E74">JTA</a> and <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_CDA3C2530A74433CBE0204D588C237AC">global transaction</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cache-writer"><a id="glossary__section_40FFA1BD5E4A4E3084AE8B257C612EDE" class="no-quick-link"></a>cache writer</h2>

<p>User-implemented plug-in intended for synchronizing the cache with an outside data source. A region’s cache writer is a synchronous listener to cache data events. The cache writer has the ability to abort a data modification. See also <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_688E118C48B246AF9D2AAB64AE9481D4">cache listener</a> and <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_3B75FF1066664923B2C9A61BDA133559">netWrite</a>.</p>

<h2 id="client"><a id="glossary__section_109B7961FDFC4EED8C1802E84031B38D" class="no-quick-link"></a>client</h2>

<p>A Geode application that is configured as a standalone distributed system member, with regions configured as client regions. Client configuration uses the &lt;client-cache&gt; <code>cache.xml</code> element and the ClientCache API.</p>

<h2 id="client-region"><a id="glossary__section_A586ED6889724255957630F01B2E54F4" class="no-quick-link"></a>client region</h2>

<p>A Geode cache region that is configured to go to one or more Geode servers, in a separate Geode distributed system, for all data distribution activities. Among other things, client regions go to servers to satisfy cache misses, distribute data modifications, and to run single queries and continuous queries.</p>

<h2 id="cluster-configuration-service">cluster configuration service</h2>

<p>The cluster configuration service saves cluster configurations created by gfsh commands to the locators in a cluster and distributes the configurations to members of the cluster.</p>

<h2 id="collection"><a id="glossary__section_054DE9007EFB49119CE9B4725DCA6C14" class="no-quick-link"></a>collection</h2>

<p>Used in the context of a query for a group of distinct objects of homogeneous type, referred to as elements. Valid collections include the <code>java.util.Collection</code> as well as Set, Map, List, and arrays. The elements in a collection can be iterated over. Iteration over a Map traverses its entries as instances of Map.Entry. A region can also be treated as a collection of its values.</p>

<h2 id="commit"><a id="glossary__section_F8C00E335E9C4F1EA717F717B2A0E7FE" class="no-quick-link"></a>commit</h2>

<p>A transactional operation that merges a transaction’s result into the cache. Changes are made in an &ldquo;all or none&rdquo; fashion. Other changes from outside the current transaction are kept separate from those being committed.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-level"><a id="glossary__section_3699AD8BD21249178882247DF7C12104" class="no-quick-link"></a>concurrency-level</h2>

<p>Region attribute that specifies an estimate of the number of threads ever expected to concurrently modify values in the region. The actual concurrency may vary; this value is used to optimize the allocation of system resources.</p>

<h2 id="conflation"><a id="glossary__section_3FEC7A097CE247299F47EA209C5F91B8" class="no-quick-link"></a>conflation</h2>

<p>Combining entries in a message queue for better performance. When an event is added to queue, if a similar event exists in the queue, there are two ways to conflate the events. One way is to remove the existing entry from wherever it resides in the queue, and add the new entry to the end of the queue. The other way is to replace the existing entry with the new entry, where it resides in the queue, and add nothing to the end of the queue. In Geode, region entry update events, server events going to clients, and gateway sender events going to remote distributed systems can all be conflated.</p>

<h2 id="connection"><a id="glossary__section_6D18D4A3D0D046E6B3664B4C95065EB3" class="no-quick-link"></a>connection</h2>

<p>The connection used by an application to access a Geode system. A Java application connects to its Geode distributed system when it creates its cache. The application must connect to a distributed system to gain access to the Geode functionalities. A client connects to a running Geode server to distribute data and events between itself and the server tier. These client connections are managed by server connection pools within the client applications. Gateway senders connect to a remote gateway receiver to distribute data events between sites.</p>

<h2 id="consumer"><a id="glossary__section_32D2C413690A4F44BA8F7B0F2AF3CD1A" class="no-quick-link"></a>consumer</h2>

<p>Geode member process that receives data and/or events from other members. Peer consumers are often configured with replicated regions, so all changes in the distributed system arrive into the local cache. Client consumers can register subscriptions with their servers so that updates are automatically forwarded from the server tier. See <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_8742E7E064364DED98D4D399B98DBCF3">producer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="coordinator"><a id="glossary__section_E02DBBD928D54E8C82EC59B5CCC528EF" class="no-quick-link"></a>coordinator</h2>

<p>The member of the distributed system that sends out membership views. This is typically the locator in Geode.</p>

<h2 id="data-accessor"><a id="glossary__section_6049C4E876C24615B245D8E2A92E3D89" class="no-quick-link"></a>data accessor</h2>

<p>In the context of a region, a member configured to use a region, but not store any data for it in the member’s local cache. Common use cases for data accessors are thin clients, and thin producer and consumer applications. Accessors can put data into the region and receive events for the region from remote members or servers, but they store no data in the application. See also <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_CC99958C53D84AD38E15E3BEDEA5F61D">data store</a>.</p>

<h2 id="data-entry"><a id="glossary__section_A8EE060D11E645D3B3FCDE0E5181F163" class="no-quick-link"></a>data entry</h2>

<p>See <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_5D8ED880C9BD4062BE6F0404B28FA005">entry</a>.</p>

<h2 id="data-fabric"><a id="glossary__section_6D48D75AAC28486697EA3A5E66AEEF04" class="no-quick-link"></a>data fabric</h2>

<p>Also referred to as an in-memory data grid or an enterprise data fabric. Geode is an implementation of a data fabric. A data fabric is a distributed, memory-based data management platform that uses cluster-wide resources &ndash; memory, CPU, network bandwidth, and optionally local disk &ndash; to manage application data and application logic (behavior). The data fabric uses dynamic replication and data partitioning techniques to offer continuous availability, very high performance, and linear scalability for data intensive applications, all without compromising on data consistency even when exposed to failure conditions.</p>

<h2 id="data-policy"><a id="glossary__section_41C4996366BF4CD4BF290E6DF6E2F20D" class="no-quick-link"></a>data-policy</h2>

<p>Region attribute used to determine what events the region receives from remote caches, whether data is stored in the local cache, and whether the data is persisted to disk. For disk persistence, writes are performed according to the cache disk-store configuration.</p>

<h2 id="data-region-(region)"><a id="glossary__section_348DF8B2F8984813897E1BCEB2CEDD59" class="no-quick-link"></a>data region (region)</h2>

<p>A logical grouping of data within a cache. Regions usually contain data entries (see entry). Each region has a set of region attributes governing activities such as expiration, distribution, data loading, events, and capacity control. In addition, a region can have an application-defined user attribute.</p>

<h2 id="data-store"><a id="glossary__section_CC99958C53D84AD38E15E3BEDEA5F61D" class="no-quick-link"></a>data store</h2>

<p>In the context of a region, a member configured to store data for the region. This is used mostly for partitioned regions, where data is spread across the distributed system among the data stores. See also <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_6049C4E876C24615B245D8E2A92E3D89">data accessor</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deadlock"><a id="glossary__section_53D31D86FA12426E8412A2F45BBAE34A" class="no-quick-link"></a>deadlock</h2>

<p>A situation in which two or more processes are waiting indefinitely for events that will never occur.</p>

<h2 id="destroy"><a id="glossary__section_179D08FF635F4A939F59C44914254410" class="no-quick-link"></a>destroy</h2>

<p>Distributed: To remove a cached object across the distributed cache.</p>

<p>Local: To remove a cached object from the local cache only.</p>

<h2 id="disk-region"><a id="glossary__section_C2B05EDE9FDB478AB99C8DCD290A91B3" class="no-quick-link"></a>disk region</h2>

<p>A persistent region.</p>

<h2 id="disk-store"><a id="glossary__section_672E5F70BE09465589253DEA25FA90EA" class="no-quick-link"></a>disk-store</h2>

<p>Cache element specifying location and write behavior for disk storage. Used for persistence and overflow of data. The cache can have multiple disk stores, which are specified by name for region attributes, client subscription queues (for servers), and WAN gateway sender queues.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-cache"><a id="glossary__section_1BE6131144994E89A8F68685D8DCF490" class="no-quick-link"></a>distributed cache</h2>

<p>A collection of caches spread across multiple machines and multiple locations that functions as a single cache for the individual applications.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-system"><a id="glossary__section_94901F2666594813BAE6761DF4CEF0ED" class="no-quick-link"></a>distributed system</h2>

<p>One or more Geode system members that have been configured to communicate cache events with each other, forming a single, logical system.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-ack-scope"><a id="glossary__section_FC39A1F63F4D40FC9B3DF00F1A75282E" class="no-quick-link"></a>distributed-ack scope</h2>

<p>Data distribution setting that causes synchronous distribution operations, which wait for acknowledgment from other caches before continuing. Operations from multiple caches can arrive out of order. This scope is slower but more reliable than distributed-no-ack.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-no-ack-scope"><a id="glossary__section_35D0344DB4684FD69EFC01F599F2F349" class="no-quick-link"></a>distributed-no-ack-scope</h2>

<p>Data distribution setting that causes asynchronous distribution operations, which return without waiting for a response from other caches. This scope produces the best performance, but is prone to race conditions.</p>

<h2 id="entry"><a id="glossary__section_5D8ED880C9BD4062BE6F0404B28FA005" class="no-quick-link"></a>entry</h2>

<p>A data object in a region consisting of a key and a value. The value is either null (invalid) or a Java object. A region entry knows what region it is in. An entry can have an application-defined user attribute. See also <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_CDA009928A3041F2AEE914F7BD3590C7">region data</a>, <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_1B630E274E6B45D2850A405276A39307">entry key</a>, and <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_C79B084B7945436C89518D64E75E1D8E">entry value</a>.</p>

<p>The data contained in an entry.</p>

<h2 id="event"><a id="glossary__section_2AF9B98BC1CA402A9F24E552EE9C9ACF" class="no-quick-link"></a>event</h2>

<p>An action recognized by the Geode system members, which can respond by executing callback methods. The Geode API produces two types of events: cache events for detail-level management of applications with data caches and administrative events for higher-level management of the distributed system and its components. An operation can produce administrative events, cache events, or both.</p>

<h2 id="eviction-attributes"><a id="glossary__section_1B57CC3632B843AA89CB321489C3B91C" class="no-quick-link"></a>eviction-attributes</h2>

<p>Region attribute that causes the cache to limit the size of the region by removing old entries to make space for new ones.</p>

<h2 id="expiration"><a id="glossary__section_FA56C0CD24254B18B6B428BAD00F45D0" class="no-quick-link"></a>expiration</h2>

<p>A cached object expires when its time-to-live or idle timeout counters are exhausted. A region has one set of expiration attributes for itself and one set for all of its entries.</p>

<h2 id="expiration-action"><a id="glossary__section_5ADAA5E628FB421999C286D38A2AA1DD" class="no-quick-link"></a>expiration action</h2>

<p>The action to be taken when a cached object expires. The expiration action specifies whether the object is to be invalidated or destroyed and whether the action is to be performed only in the local cache or throughout the distributed system. A destroyed object is completely removed from the cache. A region is invalidated by invalidating all entries contained in the region. An entry is invalidated by having its value marked as invalid. Region.getEntry.getValue returns null for an invalid entry.</p>

<p>In Geode, expiration attributes are set at the region level for the region and at the entry level for entries. See also idle timeout and time-to-live.</p>

<h2 id="factory-method"><a id="glossary__section_5CFFD2274BAD4A73849B3AA854BA4661" class="no-quick-link"></a>factory method</h2>

<p>An interface for creating an object which at creation time can let its subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The factory method helps instantiate the appropriate subclass by creating the correct object from a group of related classes.</p>

<p>The User Datagram Protocol is a part of the internet protocol (IP) suite that provides simple, unreliable transmission of datagram messages from one process to another. Reliability must be implemented by applications using UDP. The UDP protocol is connectionless, meaning that the same UDP socket can be used to send or receive messages to or from more than one process. Compare to <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_574E58CDEB9D4E93B0F042883A780B74">TCP</a>.</p>

<h2 id="unicast"><a id="glossary__section_9EF1D3F165554BF2BA8C4A8BFC2AA9E1" class="no-quick-link"></a>unicast</h2>

<p>A message sent from one process to another process (point-to-point communications). Both UDP and TCP provide unicast messaging.</p>

<h2 id="uri"><a id="glossary__section_FB9A30181A9A481594848CABA28EE1FC" class="no-quick-link"></a>URI</h2>

<h2 id="user-attribute"><a id="glossary__section_6D2DED48DC5D464CA4959668C3BA38D5" class="no-quick-link"></a>user attribute</h2>

<p>An optional object associated with a region or a data entry where an application can store data about the region or entry. The data is accessed by the application only. Geode does not use these attributes. Compare to region attributes, which are used by Geode.</p>

<h2 id="value-constraint"><a id="glossary__section_8386E2FB49424CA4B5F0343F9E6A04E5" class="no-quick-link"></a>value constraint</h2>

<p>Enforcing a specific entry value type. The value-constraint region attribute, when set, constrains the entries in the region to values of the specified object type. Value constraints can be used to provide object typing for region querying and indexing. The value-constraint is only checked in the cache that does the entry put or create operation. When the entry is distributed to other caches, the value constraint is not checked.</p>

<h2 id="value-index"><a id="glossary__section_927F5452A1C840B9BFA119693CA5B26F" class="no-quick-link"></a>value-index</h2>

<p>An XPath index that operates much as a structure-index does, but that separates the nodes that match the XPath expression into sets mapped by each node’s value. This allows further filtering of the nodes to be evaluated in a query by going directly to those with a specific value. See also <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_78C4D8B8C40E4A5688F2426A3F46A234">structure-index</a> and <a href="glossary.html#glossary__section_E21653B0F7CD4E7E9C51731EB0362228">range-index</a>.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-machine"><a id="glossary__section_E49E2FFF34FC4B2A9E3FF1FF77DCE5DF" class="no-quick-link"></a>Virtual Machine</h2>

<p>A completely isolated operating system installation within your normal operating system. This is generally implemented by software emulation or hardware virtualization.</p>

<h2 id="vmware-virtual-machine"><a id="glossary__section_754A470EEE424D42A9981D068936631B" class="no-quick-link"></a>VMware virtual machine</h2>

<p>Also referred to as a VMware VM. A VMware VM is a tightly isolated software container that can run its own operating systems and applications as if it were a physical computer. A VMware VM behaves exactly like a physical computer and contains it own virtual (ie, software-based) CPU, RAM hard disk and network interface card (NIC). An operating system can&rsquo;t tell the difference between a VMware VM and a physical machine, nor can applications or other computers on a network. Even the VMware VM thinks it is a &ldquo;real&rdquo; computer. Nevertheless, a VMware VM is composed entirely of software and contains no hardware components whatsoever.</p>

<h2 id="xml"><a id="glossary__section_B7758E29850D459DA197C0FDF25508E1" class="no-quick-link"></a>XML</h2>

<p>EXtensible Markup Language. An open standard for describing data, XML is a markup language similar to HTML. Both are designed to describe and transform data, but where HTML uses predefined tags, XML allows tags to be defined inside the XML document itself. Thus, virtually any data item can be identified. The XML programmer creates and implements data-appropriate tags whose syntax is defined in a DTD file or an XSD (XML schema definition.)</p>

<h2 id="xml-schema-definition"><a id="glossary__section_B65D71221D6F4F02B829EE4DB12FFCAB" class="no-quick-link"></a>XML schema definition</h2>

<p>The definition of the structure, content, and semantics used in an XML document. The definition can be used to verify that each item of content in a document adheres to the specification of the element in which the content is placed. The XML schema is a superset of DTD. Unlike DTD, XML schemas are written in XML syntax, which, although more verbose than DTD, are more descriptive and can have stronger typing. Files containing XML schema definitions generally have the XSD extension.</p>

<h2 id="xpath"><a id="glossary__section_36183B68888F4C49B5E5F36D16C12710" class="no-quick-link"></a>XPath</h2>

<p>A language that describes a way to locate and process items in Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents by using an addressing syntax based on a path through the document&rsquo;s logical structure or hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="xsd">XSD</h2>

<p>See XML schema definition.</p>
