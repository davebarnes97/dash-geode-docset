<p>This section describes the primary statistics gathered by Geode when statistics are enabled.</p>

<p>All statistics gathering requires the <code>gemfire.properties</code> <code>statistic-sampling-enabled</code> in <code>gemfire.properties</code> file to be true. Statistics that use time require the <code>gemfire.properties</code> <code>enable-time-statistics</code> to be true.</p>

<p>Performance statistics are collected for each Java application or cache server that connects to a distributed system.</p>

<p>Statistics for the Geode cache. These can be used to determine the type and number of cache operations being performed and how much time they consume.</p>

<p>Regarding Geode cache transactions, transaction-related statistics are compiled and stored as properties in the CachePerfStats statistic resource. Because the transaction’s data scope is the cache, these statistics are collected on a per-cache basis.</p>

<p>The primary statistics are:</p>

<table><thead>

Note that some members may discard an update while other members apply the update, depending on the order in which each member receives the update. For this reason, the <code>conflatedEvents</code> statistic will differ for each Geode member.
