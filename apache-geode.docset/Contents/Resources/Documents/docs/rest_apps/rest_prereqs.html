<p>Before development, it is important to understand the prerequisites and limitations of the Geode REST implementation.</p>

<p>Geode and REST-enabled applications accessing Geode are subject to the following rules and limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>  All domain objects, functions and function-arg classes must be properly configured and registered in the Geode deployment. Any functions that you wish to execute through the REST API must be available on the target memberâ€™s CLASSPATH.</li>
<li>  The current implementation supports only the <strong>application/json</strong> MIME type. Other return types (XML, objects, and so on) are not supported. Plain text is supported as a return type for some error messages.</li>
<li>  Keys are strictly of type String. For example, the request <code>PUT http://localhost:8080/gemfire-api/v1/customers/123.456</code> will add an entry for key (&ldquo;123.456&rdquo;) of type String.</li>
<li>  Some special formats of JSON documents are not supported in Geode REST. See <a href="troubleshooting.html#concept_gsv_zd5_m4">Key Types and JSON Support</a> for examples.</li>
<li>  To achieve interoperability between Geode Java clients (or Geode native clients) and REST clients, the following rules must be followed:

<ul>
<li>  All Geode Java and native client classes operating on data also accessed by the REST interface must be PDX serialized, either via PDX autoserialization or by implementing <code>PdxSerializable</code>.</li>
<li>  Geode Java clients and native clients can retrieve REST-enabled data either as a <code>PdxInstance</code> or as an actual object by using the <code>PdxInstance.getObject</code> method. If you use the latter method, you must first declare the object type (@type) in your POST or PUT request payload when creating the object in REST; and secondly, the Java client must have the actual domain class in its CLASSPATH.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>  Objects returned by REST-invoked functions must be returned as PdxInstance objects or other data types that can be written to JSON. You cannot return Java objects.</li>
<li>  REST client applications do not support single hop access or notification features.</li>
<li>  Specifying subregions as endpoints is not supported.</li>
</ul>
