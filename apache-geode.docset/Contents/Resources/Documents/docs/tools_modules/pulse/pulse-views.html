<p>Pulse provides a variety of different views to help you monitor Geode clusters, members, and regions.</p>

<p>The following sections provide an overview of the main Pulse views:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_9794B5754E474E10ABFBCD8B1DA240F8">Cluster View</a></li>

<p>The cluster view is a high-level overview of the Geode distributed system. It is displayed immediately after you log into Pulse. Information displays around the perimeter of the cluster view show statistics such as memory usage, JVM pauses, and throughput. You can use the cluster view to drill down into details for individual members and regions in the distributed system.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/pulse_cluster_view.png" id="topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__image_CC7B54903DF24030850E55965CDB6EC4" class="image imageleft" width="624" /></p>

<p>Use these basic controls while in Cluster view:</p>

<ol>
<li> Click Members or Data to display information about Geode members or data regions in the distributed system.</li>
<li><p>Click the display icons to display the Geode members using icon view, block view, or table view. Note that icon view is available only when displaying Members.</p>

<p>For example, the following shows Geode Members displayed in table view:</p>

<p><img src="../../images/member_view_list.png" id="topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__image_npw_sq3_wn" class="image" /></p>

<ul>
<li>  While in block view or table view, click the name of a Geode member to display additional information in the <a href="#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_3629814A3DF64D31A190495782DB0DBF">Member View</a>.</li>
<li>  Click Topology, Server Groups, or Redundancy Zones to filter the view based on all members in the topology, configured server groups, or configured redundancy zones.
The following shows Geode Regions displayed in table view:

<li>  While in block view or table view, click the name of a Geode region to display additional information in the <a href="#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_D151776BAC8B4704A71F37F8B5CE063D">Region View</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>While in icon view, click a host machine icon to display the Geode members on that machine.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Alerts pane, click the severity tabs to filter the message display by the level of severity.</p></li>

<p>The Pulse Data Browser enables you to query region data. Note that there are two key attributes available on DistributedSystemMXBean (see <a href="../../managing/management/list_of_mbeans.html#topic_4BCF867697C3456D96066BAD7F39FC8B">List of Geode JMX MBeans</a>) that you can use to configure limits for the result sets displayed in Data Browser:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <code>QueryResultSetLimit</code> limits the number of rows that Data Browser queries return. 1000 rows are displayed by default.</li>
<li>  <code>QueryCollectionsDepth</code> limits the number of elements of a collection that Data Browser queries return. This attribute applies to query results contain collections such as Map, List, and so forth. The default value is 100 elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <code>org.apache.geode.management.DistributedSystemMXBean</code> JavaDocs for information on available MBean methods and attributes.</p>

<p>The following shows an example Data Browser view:</p>

<p>Use these basic controls while in Data Browser view:</p>

<ol>
<li> Search for the name of a specific region.</li>
<li> Select one or more regions to display the Geode members that host those regions. The hosting Geode members appear in the Region Members section.</li>
<li> Select one or more members from the Region Members section to restrict query results to those members.</li>
<li> Type in the text of a query to execute. See <a href="../../developing/querying_basics/chapter_overview.html">Querying</a>.</li>
