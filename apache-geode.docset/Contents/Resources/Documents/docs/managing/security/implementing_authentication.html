<p>Authentication lends a measure of security to a distributed system
by verifying the identity of components as they connect to the system.
All components use the same authentication mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="how-authentication-works">How Authentication Works</h2>

<p>When a component initiates a connection to the distributed system,
the <code>SecurityManager.authenticate</code> method is invoked.
The component provides its credentials in the form of properties
as a parameter to the <code>authenticate</code> method.
The credential is presumed to be the two properties
<code>security-username</code> and <code>security-password</code>.
The <code>authenticate</code> method is expected to either return an object
representing a principal or throw an <code>AuthenticationFailedException</code>.</p>

<p>A well-designed <code>authenticate</code> method will have a set of known user and password pairs that can be
compared to the credential presented or will have a way of obtaining those pairs.</p>

<h2 id="how-a-server-sets-its-credential">How a Server Sets Its Credential</h2>

<p>In order to connect with a locator that does authentication,
a server will need to set its credential, composed of the two properties
<code>security-username</code> and <code>security-password</code>.
There are two ways of accomplishing this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set the <code>security-username</code> and <code>security-password</code> in the server&rsquo;s
<code>gfsecurity.properties</code> file that will be read upon server start up,
as in the example</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> security-username=admin
 security-password=xyz1234
</code></pre>

<p>The user name and password are stored in the clear, so the
<code>gfsecurity.properties</code> file must be protected by restricting access with
file system permissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement the <code>getCredentials</code> method of the <code>AuthInitialize</code> interface
for the server.
This callback&rsquo;s location is defined in the property <code>security-peer-auth-init</code>,
as in the example</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> security-peer-auth-init=com.example.security.MyAuthInitialize
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation of <code>getCredentials</code> may then acquire values for
the properties <code>security-username</code> and <code>security-password</code> in whatever way
it wishes.
It might look up values in a database or another external resource.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Gateway senders and receivers communicate as a component of their
server member.
Therefore, the credential of the server become those of the gateway
sender or receiver.</p>

<h2 id="how-a-cache-client-sets-its-credential">How a Cache Client Sets Its Credential</h2>

<!--  Revised for GEODE-1883
In order to connect with a locator or a server that does authentication,
a client will need to set its credential, composed of the two properties
`security-username` and `security-password`.
There are two ways of accomplishing this:

- Set the `security-username` and `security-password` in the client's
`gfsecurity.properties` file that will be read upon client start up,
as in the example

     ``` pre
     security-username=clientapp
     security-password=xyz1234
     ```
The user name and password are stored in the clear, so the
`gfsecurity.properties` file must be protected by restricting access with
file system permissions.
To accomplish this:

- Implement the `getCredentials` method of the `AuthInitialize` interface
for the client.
This callback's location is defined in the property `security-client-auth-init`,
as in the example

     ``` pre
     security-client-auth-init=com.example.security.ClientAuthInitialize
     ```
The implementation of `getCredentials` may then acquire values for
the properties `security-username` and `security-password` in whatever way
it wishes.
It might look up values in a database or another external resource,
or it might prompt for values.

<h2 id="how-other-components-set-their-credentials">How Other Components Set Their Credentials</h2>

<p><code>gfsh</code> prompts for the user name and password upon invocation of
a<code>gfsh connect</code> command.</p>

<p>Pulse prompts for the user name and password upon start up.</p>

<p>Due to the stateless nature of the REST API,
a web application or other component that speaks to a server or locator
via the REST API goes through authentication on each request.
The header of the request needs to include attributes that define values for
<code>security-username</code> and <code>security-password</code>.</p>

<h2 id="implement-securitymanager-interface">Implement SecurityManager Interface</h2>

<p>Complete these items to implement authentication done by either a
locator or a server.</p>

<ul>
<li>Decide upon an authentication algorithm.
The <a href="authentication_examples.html">Authentication Example</a>
stores a set of user name and
password pairs that represent the identities of components
that will connect to the system.
This simplistic algorithm returns the user name as a principal
if the user name and password passed to the <code>authenticate</code> method
are a match for one of the stored pairs.</li>
<li>Define the <code>security-manager</code> property.
See <a href="enable_security.html">Enable Security with Property Definitions</a>
for details about this property.</li>
<li>Implement the  <code>authenticate</code> method of the <code>SecurityManager</code> interface.</li>
<li>Define any extra resources that the implemented authentication algorithm
needs in order to make a decision.</li>
</ul>
