<p>For replicated, distributed, and local regions, Geode provides a standard set of statistics for the region and its entries.</p>

<p>Geode gathers these statistics when the <code>--enable-statistics</code> parameter of the <code>create region</code> command of <code>gfsh</code> is set to true or in cache.xml the region attribute <code>statistics-enabled</code> is set to true.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Unlike other Geode statistics, these region and entry statistics are not archived and cannot be charted.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Enabling these statistics requires extra memory per entry. See <a href="../../reference/topics/memory_requirements_for_cache_data.html#calculating_memory_requirements">Memory Requirements for Cached Data</a>.</p>

<p>These are the transient statistics gathered for all but partitioned regions:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Hit and miss counts</strong>. For the entry, the hit count is the number of times the cached entry was accessed through the <code>Region.get</code> method and the miss count is the number of times these hits did not find a valid value. For the region these counts are the totals for all entries in the region. The API provides <code>get</code> methods for the hit and miss counts, a convenience method that returns the hit-to-miss ratio, and a method for zeroing the counts.</li>
<li>  <strong>Last accessed time</strong>. For the entry, this is the last time a valid value was retrieved from the locally cached entry. For the region, this is the most recent &ldquo;last accessed time&rdquo; for all entries contained in the region. This statistic is used for idle timeout expiration activities.</li>
<li>  <strong>Last modified time</strong>. For the entry, this is the last time the entry value was updated (directly or through distribution) due to a load, create, or put operation. For the region, this is the most recent &ldquo;last modified time&rdquo; for all entries contained in the region. This statistic is used for time to live and idle timeout expiration activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The hit and miss counts collected in these statistics can be useful for fine-tuning your system’s caches. If you have a region’s entry expiration enabled, for example, and see a high ratio of misses to hits on the entries, you might choose to increase the expiration times.</p>

<p>Retrieve region and entry statistics through the <code>getStatistics</code> methods of the <code>Region</code> and <code>Region.Entry</code> objects.</p>
