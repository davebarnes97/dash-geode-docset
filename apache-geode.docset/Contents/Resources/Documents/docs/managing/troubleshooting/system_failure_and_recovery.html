<p>This section describes alerts for and appropriate responses to various kinds of system failures. It also helps you plan a strategy for data recovery.</p>

<p>If a system member withdraws from the distributed system involuntarily because the member, host, or network fails, the other members automatically adapt to the loss and continue to operate. The distributed system does not experience any disturbance such as timeouts.</p>

<h2 id="planning-for-data-recovery"><a id="sys_failure__section_846B00118184487FB8F1E0CD1DC3A81B" class="no-quick-link"></a>Planning for Data Recovery</h2>

<p>In planning a strategy for data recovery, consider these factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Whether the region is configured for data redundancy—partitioned regions only.</li>
<li>  The region’s role-loss policy configuration, which controls how the region behaves after a crash or system failure—distributed regions only.</li>
<li>  Whether the region is configured for persistence to disk.</li>
<li>  The extent of the failure, whether multiple members or a network outage is involved.</li>
<li>  Your application’s specific needs, such as the difficulty of replacing the data and the risk of running with inconsistent data for your application.</li>
<li>  When an alert is generated due to network partition or slow response, indicating that certain processes may, or will, fail.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of this section provides recovery instructions for various kinds system failures.</p>

<p>When a network partition detection or slow responses occur, these alerts are generated:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Network Partitioning is Detected</li>
<li>  Member is Taking Too Long to Respond</li>
<li>  No Locators Can Be Found</li>
<li>  Warning Notifications Before Removal</li>
<li>  Member is Forced Out</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-restart-fails-due-to-out-of-memory-error"><a id="restart-failure-persistent-lru" class="no-quick-link"></a> Restart Fails Due To Out-of-Memory Error</h2>

<p>This section describes a restart failure that can occur when the stopped system is one that was configured with persistent regions. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some of the regions of the recovering system, when running, were configured as PERSISTENT regions, which means that they save their data to disk.</li>
<li>At least one of the persistent regions was configured to evict least recently used (LRU) data by overflowing values to disk.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-data-is-recovered-from-persistent-regions">How Data is Recovered From Persistent Regions</h3>

<p>Data recovery, upon restart, always recovers keys. You can configure whether and how the system
recovers the values associated with those keys to populate the system cache.</p>

<p><strong>Value Recovery</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Recovering all values immediately during startup slows the startup time but results in consistent
read performance after the startup on a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; cache.</p></li>
<li><p>Recovering no values means quicker startup but a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; cache, so the first retrieval of each value will read from disk.</p></li>
<li><p>Retrieving values asynchronously in a background thread allows a relatively quick startup on a &ldquo;warm&rdquo; cache
that will eventually recover every value.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Retrieve or Ignore LRU values</strong></p>

<p>When a system with persistent LRU regions shuts down, the system does not record which of the values
were recently used. On subsequent startup, if values are recovered into an LRU region they may be
the least recently used instead of the most recently used. Also, if LRU values are recovered on a
heap or an off-heap LRU region, it is possible that the LRU memory limit will be exceeded, resulting
in an <code>OutOfMemoryException</code> during recovery. For these reasons, LRU value recovery can be treated
differently than non-LRU values.</p>

<h2 id="default-recovery-behavior-for-persistent-regions">Default Recovery Behavior for Persistent Regions</h2>

<p>The default behavior is for the system to recover all keys, then asynchronously recover all data
values, leaving LRU values unrecovered. This default strategy is best for
most applications, because it strikes a balance between recovery speed and cache completeness.</p>

<h3 id="configuring-recovery-of-persistent-regions">Configuring Recovery of Persistent Regions</h3>

<p>Three Java system parameters allow the developer to control the recovery behavior for persistent regions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gemfire.disk.recoverValues</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Default = <code>true</code>, recover values. If <code>false</code>, recover only keys, do not recover values.</p>

<p><em>How used:</em> When <code>true</code>, recovery of the values &ldquo;warms up&rdquo; the cache so data retrievals will find
  their values in the cache, without causing time consuming disk accesses. When <code>false</code>, shortens
  recovery time so the system becomes available for use sooner, but the first retrieval on each key
  will require a disk read.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gemfire.disk.recoverLruValues</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Default = <code>false</code>, do not recover LRU values. If <code>true</code>, recover LRU values. If
  <code>gemfire.disk.recoverValues</code> is <code>false</code>, then <code>gemfire.disk.recoverLruValues</code> is ignored, since
  no values are recovered.</p>

<p><em>How used:</em> When <code>false</code>, shortens recovery time by ignoring LRU values. When <code>true</code>, restores
  more data values to the cache. Recovery of the LRU values increases heap memory usage and
  could cause an out-of-memory error, preventing the system from restarting.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gemfire.disk.recoverValuesSync</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Default = <code>false</code>, recover values by an asynchronous background process. If <code>true</code>, values are
  recovered synchronously, and recovery is not complete until all values have been retrieved.  If
  <code>gemfire.disk.recoverValues</code> is <code>false</code>, then <code>gemfire.disk.recoverValuesSync</code> is ignored since
  no values are recovered.</p>

<p><em>How used:</em> When <code>false</code>, allows the system to become available sooner, but some time must elapse
  before all values have been read from disk into cache memory. Some key retrievals will require disk access, and some will not.
  When <code>true</code>, prolongs restart time, but ensures that when available for use, the cache is fully
  populated and data retrieval times will be optimal.</p>
