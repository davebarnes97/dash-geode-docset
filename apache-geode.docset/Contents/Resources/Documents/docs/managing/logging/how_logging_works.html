<p>Apache Geode uses Apache Log4j 2 as the basis for its logging system.</p>

<p>Geode uses <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/">Apache Log4j 2</a> API and Core libraries as the basis for its logging system. Log4j 2 API is a popular and powerful front-end logging API used by all the Geode classes to generate log statements. Log4j 2 Core is a backend implementation for logging; you can route any of the front-end logging API libraries to log to this backend. Geode uses the Core backend to run two custom Log4j 2 Appenders: <strong>AlertAppender</strong> and <strong>LogWriterAppender</strong>.</p>

<p>Geode has been tested with Log4j 2.1.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
For this reason, Geode now always requires the following JARs to be in the classpath: <code>log4j-api-2.1.jar</code>, <code>log4j-core-2.1.jar</code>. Both of these JARs are distributed in the <code>$GEMFIRE/lib</code> directory and included in the appropriate <code>*-dependencies.jar</code> convenience libraries.</p>

<p><strong>AlertAppender</strong> is the component that generates Geode alerts that are then managed by the JMX Management and Monitoring system. See <a href="../management/notification_federation_and_alerts.html#topic_212EE5A2ABAB4E8E8EF71807C9ECEF1A">Notification Federation</a> for more details.</p>

<p><strong>LogWriterAppender</strong> is the component that is configured by all the <code>log-*</code> Geode properties such as <code>log-file</code>, <code>log-file-size-limit</code> and <code>log-disk-space-limit</code>.</p>

<p>Both of these appenders are created and controlled programmatically. You configure their behavior with the <code>log-*</code> Geode properties and the alert level that is configured within the JMX Management &amp; Monitoring system. These appenders do not currently support configuration within a <code>log4j2.xml</code> config file.</p>

<p>Advanced users may wish to define their own <code>log4j2.xml</code>. See <a href="configuring_log4j2.html">Advanced Usersâ€”Configuring Log4j 2 for Geode</a> for more details.</p>
