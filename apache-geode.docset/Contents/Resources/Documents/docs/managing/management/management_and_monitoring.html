<p>Apache Geode provides APIs and tools for managing your distributed system and monitoring the health of your distributed system members.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="management_and_monitoring_features.html">Management and Monitoring Features</a></strong></p>

<p>Apache Geode uses a federated Open MBean strategy to manage and monitor all members of the distributed system. This strategy gives you a consolidated, single-agent view of the distributed system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="mm_overview.html">Overview of Geode Management and Monitoring Tools</a></strong></p>

<p>Geode provides a variety of management tools you can use to manage a Geode distributed system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="management_system_overview.html">Architecture and Components</a></strong></p>

<p>Geode&rsquo;s management and monitoring system consists of one JMX Manager node (there should only be one) and one or more managed nodes within a distributed system. All members in the distributed system are manageable through MBeans and Geode Management Service APIs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="jmx_manager_node.html#topic_36C918B4202D45F3AC225FFD23B11D7C">JMX Manager Operations</a></strong></p>

<p>Any member can host an embedded JMX Manager, which provides a federated view of all MBeans for the distributed system. The member can be configured to be a manager at startup or anytime during its life by invoking the appropriate API calls on the ManagementService.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="mbean_architecture.html">Federated MBean Architecture</a></strong></p>

<p>Geode uses MBeans to manage and monitor different parts of Geode. Geode&rsquo;s federated MBean architecture is scalable and allows you to have a single-agent view of a Geode distributed system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="configuring_rmi_connector.html">Configuring RMI Registry Ports and RMI Connectors</a></strong></p>

<p>Geode programmatically emulates out-of-the-box JMX provided by Java and creates a JMXServiceURL with RMI Registry and RMI Connector ports on all manageable members.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="gfsh_and_management_api.html">Executing gfsh Commands through the Management API</a></strong></p>

<p>You can also use management APIs to execute gfsh commands programmatically.</p></li>
