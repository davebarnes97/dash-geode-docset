<p>Apache Geode uses a federated Open MBean strategy to manage and monitor all members of the distributed system. This strategy gives you a consolidated, single-agent view of the distributed system.</p>

<p><a id="concept_F7B9EE348DA744D3BBDFD68E7F48A604__section_37CECE9B26644505A79784EA0CD1FDAE"></a>
Application and manager development is much easier because you do not have to find the right MBeanServer to make a request on an MBean. Instead, you interact with a single MBeanServer that aggregates MBeans from all other local and remote MBeanServers.</p>

<p>Some other key advantages and features of Geode administration architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Geode monitoring is tightly integrated into Geode&rsquo;s processes instead of running in a separately installed and configured monitoring agent. You can use the same framework to actually manage Geode and perform administrative operations, not just monitor it.</li>
<li>  All Geode MBeans are <em>MXBeans</em>. They represent useful and relevant information on the state of the distributed system and all its members. Because MXBeans use the Open MBean model with a predefined set of types, clients and remote management programs no longer require access to model-specific classes representing your MBean types. Using MXBeans adds flexibility to your selection of clients and makes the Geode management and monitoring much easier to use.</li>
<li>  Each member in the distributed system is manageable through MXBeans, and each member hosts its own MXBeans in a Platform MBeanServer.</li>
<li>  Any Geode member can be configured to provide a federated view of all the MXBeans for all members in a Geode cluster.</li>
<li>  Geode has also modified its use of JMX to be industry-standard and friendly to generic JMX clients. You can now easily monitor or manage the distributed system by using any third-party tool that is compliant with JMX. For example, JConsole.</li>
</ul>
