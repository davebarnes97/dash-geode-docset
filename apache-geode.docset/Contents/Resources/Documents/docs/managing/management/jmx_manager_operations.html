<p>JMX Manager nodes are members that manage other Geode members (as well as themselves). A JMX Manager node can manage all other members in the distributed system. Typically a locator will function as the JMX Manager, but you can also turn any other distributed system member such as a server into a JMX Manager node as well.</p>

<p>To allow a server to become a JMX Manager you configure Geode property <code>jmx-manager=true</code>, in the server&rsquo;s<code>gemfire.properties</code> file. This property configures the node to become a JMX Manager node passively; if gfsh cannot locate a JMX Manager when connecting to the distributed system, the server node will be started as a JMX Manager node.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
The default property setting for all locators is <code>gemfire.jmx-manager=true</code>. For other members, the default property setting is <code>gemfire.jmx-manager=false</code>.</p>

<p>To force a server to become a JMX Manager node whenever it is started, set the Geode properties <code>jmx-manager-start=true</code> and <code>jmx-manager=true</code> in the server&rsquo;s gemfire.properties file. Note that both of these properties must be set to true for the node.</p>

<p>To start the member as a JMX Manager node on the command line, provide<code>--J=-Dgemfire.jmx-manager-start=true and --J=-Dgemfire.jmx-manager=true</code> as arguments to either the <code>start server</code> or <code>start                     locator</code> command.</p>

<p>For example, to start a server as a JMX Manager on the gfsh command line:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>gfsh&gt;start server --name=&lt;server-name&gt; --J=-Dgemfire.jmx-manager=true \
--J=-Dgemfire.jmx-manager-start=true
</code></pre>

<p>By default, any locator can become a JMX Manager when started. When you start up a locator, if no other JMX Manager is detected in the distributed system, the locator starts one automatically. If you start a second locator, it will detect the current JMX Manager and will not start up another JMX Manager unless the second locator&rsquo;s <code>gemfire.jmx-manager-start</code> property is set to true.</p>

<p>For most deployments, you only need to have one JMX Manager per distributed system. However, you can run more than JMX Manager if necessary. If you want to provide high-availability and redundancy for the Pulse monitoring tool, or if you are running additional JMX clients other than gfsh, then use the <code>jmx-manager-start=true</code> property to force individual nodes (either locators or servers) to become JMX Managers at startup. Since there is some performance overhead to being a JMX Manager, we recommend using locators as JMX Managers. If you do not want a locator to become a JMX manager, then you must use the <code>jmx-manager=false</code> property when you start the locator.</p>

<p>After the node becomes a JMX Manager, all other <code>jmx-manager-*</code> configuration properties listed in <a href="jmx_manager_operations.html#topic_263072624B8D4CDBAD18B82E07AA44B6">Configuring a JMX Manager</a> are applied.</p>

<p>The following is an example of starting a new locator that also starts an embedded JMX Manager (after detecting that another JMX Manager does not exist). In addition, <code>gfsh</code> also automatically connects you to the new JMX Manager. For example:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>gfsh&gt;start locator --name=locator1
Starting a Geode Locator in /Users/username/apache-geode/locator1...
....

</code></pre>

<p>Locators also keep track of all nodes that can become a JMX Manager.</p>

<p>Immediately after creating its cache, the JMX Manager node begins federating the MBeans from other members. After the JMX Manager node is ready, the JMX Manager node sends a notification to all other members informing them that it is a new JMX Manager. The other members then put complete MBean states for themselves into each of their hidden management regions.</p>

<p>At any point, you can determine whether a node is a JMX Manager by using the MemberMXBean isManager() method.</p>

<p>Using the Java API, any managed node that has been configured with <code>jmx-manager=true</code> can also be turned into a JMX Manager Node by invoking the ManagementService startManager() method.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
If you start the JMX Manager programmatically and wish to enable command processing, you must also add the absolute path of <code>gfsh-dependencies.jar</code> (located in the <code>lib</code> directory of your installation) to the CLASSPATH of your application. Do not copy this library to your CLASSPATH, because this library refers to other dependencies in <code>lib</code> by a relative path.</p>

<p>To stop a JMX Manager using gfsh, simply shut down the locator or server hosting the JMX Manager.</p>

<p>For a locator:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>gfsh&gt;stop locator --dir=locator1
Stopping Locator running in /home/user/test2/locator1 on ubuntu.local[10334] as locator1...
Process ID: 2081
Log File: /home/user/test2/locator1/locator1.log
....
No longer connected to ubuntu.local[1099].
</code></pre>

<p>For a server:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>gfsh&gt;stop server --dir=server1
Stopping Cache Server running in /home/user/test2/server1 ubuntu.local[40404] as server1...
Process ID: 1156
Log File: /home/user/test2/server1/server1.log
....


No longer connected to ubuntu.local[1099].
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <code>gfsh</code> has automatically disconnected you from the stopped JMX Manager.</p>

<p>To stop a JMX manager using the management API, use the ManagementService stopManager() method to stop a member from being a JMX Manager.</p>

<p>When a Manager stops, it removes all federated MBeans from other members from its Platform MBeanServer. It also emits a notification to inform other members that it is no longer considered a JMX Manager.</p>
