<p>This topic describes network partitioning scenarios and what happens to the partitioned sides of the distributed system.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_svg/network_partition_scenario.svg" id="concept_357ABE91AAA042D2A20328BD01FEB882__image_6ED88C6911EE4C68A19353ABD7B1552A" class="image" /></p>

<h2 id="what-the-losing-side-does"><a id="concept_357ABE91AAA042D2A20328BD01FEB882__section_DAFBCB8BB421453EB6C5B4A348640762" class="no-quick-link"></a>What the Losing Side Does</h2>

<p>In a network partitioning scenario, the &ldquo;losing side&rdquo; constitutes the cluster partition where the membership coordinator has detected that there is an insufficient quorum of members to continue.</p>

<p>The membership coordinator calculates membership weight change after sending out its view preparation message. If a quorum of members does not remain after the view preparation phase, the coordinator on the &ldquo;losing side&rdquo; declares a network partition event and sends a network-partition-detected UDP message to the members. The coordinator then closes its distributed system with a <code>ForcedDisconnectException</code>. If a member fails to receive the message before the coordinator closes the connection, it is responsible for detecting the event on its own.</p>

<p>When the losing side discovers that a network partition event has occurred, all peer members receive a <code>RegionDestroyedException</code> with <code>Operation</code>: <code>FORCED_DISCONNECT</code>.</p>

<p>If a <code>CacheListener</code> is installed, the <code>afterRegionDestroy</code> callback is invoked with a <code>RegionDestroyedEvent</code>, as shown in this example logged by the losing side&rsquo;s callback. The peer member process IDs are 14291 (lead member) and 14296, and the locator is 14289.</p>

<p>Peers still actively performing operations on the cache may see <code>ShutdownException</code>s or <code>CacheClosedException</code>s with <code>Caused by: ForcedDisconnectException</code>.</p>

<p>When a member is isolated from all locators, it is unable to receive membership view changes. It can&rsquo;t know if the current coordinator is present or, if it has left, whether there are other members available to take over that role. In this condition, a member will eventually detect the loss of all other members and will use the loss threshold to determine whether it should shut itself down. In the case of a distributed system with 2 locators and 2 cache servers, the loss of communication with the non-lead cache server plus both locators would result in this situation and the remaining cache server would eventually shut itself down.</p>
